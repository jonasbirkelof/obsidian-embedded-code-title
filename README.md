# Obsidian Embedded Code Title Plugin

This is an Obsidian plugin which can embeds title to code blocks.

**‚ö† There is a possibility that this plugin doesn't work someday because it depends on the internal DOM structure of Obsidian.**

## üíªInstall

For now, I don't have registered community plugins. So you need to install it manually with git and npm.

```
git clone https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-embedded-code-title.git
cd obsidian-embedded-clone-title
npm run build
mkdir -p <your_vault>/.obsidian/obsidian-embedded-clone-title
cp main.js styles.css manifest.json <your_vault>/.obsidian/obsidian-embedded-clone-title/
```

## üñã Examples

### No file name

```python
def main():
    pass
```

You can also use it on the published site by Obsidian Publish with `publish/publish.js` and `publish/publish.css`.
